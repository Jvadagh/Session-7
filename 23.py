23. We can represent a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a 3  3 grid in which each position can hold one of the
following three strings: "X", "O", or " ". Write a function named check_winner that accepts a
3  3 list as a parameter. If "X" appears in a winning Tic-Tac-Toe pattern, the function should return
the string "X". If "O" appears in a winning Tic-Tac-Toe pattern, the function should return the string
"O". If no winning pattern exists, the function should return the string " ".
